5/7/14 - Binary Search Trees

1. Sorted List --> BST  | O(n)
2. Unsorted List --> BST | O(nlogn)
3. print all elements | O(n)
4. find(x) | O(logn) <--> O(n)
5. add(x) | ``
6. remove(x) | ``

3/25/14 - Iterable and Iterator
Iterator: hasNext(), next()

	  while (c.hasNext()){
		SOP(c.next());
	  }	  	  
	
	* The list is iterable, 
	* so I can use it whenever without worrying about resetting

	list is iterable if it can make an iterator w/ iterable()
	
Iterable: "I can manufacture an Iterator & give it to you"
Interface: Abstract Class; Blueprints you will use to extend your Class

4/30/14 - Typecasting 

* you are allowed to instanciate SuperClass x = new SubClass(); , 
  but not Subclass x = new SuperClass();

* you can typecast (Subclass) <instance of SuperClass>

* when you use super.Method() in a subclass, it is borrowing Method(), not turning into the superclass
