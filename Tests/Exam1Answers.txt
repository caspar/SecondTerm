1.  A - sums even indexes
2.  A - B & E have bad params, C: ints are private, D: not static(I think)
3.  B - duh
4.  C - [int/int] (greatest integer)
5.  it would actually return the address, but C - it starts with 4
6.  E - you need abs, bc you don't know which double is greater
7.  D - use setName() bc Strings are private
8.  C - if you put an integer in "'s, it's a String
9.  B - need [i - 1] because i starts at 1
10. B - will throw StackOverflowException();
11. B - if last is 0, it's ok because of 0 indexing
12. C - I took a pic
13. B
14. D - I believe, but I don't know for each-in loops v. well
15. A - II will return an OutOfBoundsException()
16. D
17. C - I took a pic
18. E
19. D - MAF
20. E
21. come 
22. back
23. to 
24. these
25. questions
26. A - x is already the element bc it's a "for each x in y" not B, D, 
27. 8 - see picture
28. E - bercause of the conditional not C, D
29. E not A, B,C
30. C
31. C
32. C - 4x (n*answer)
33. C
34. B - not III, because vars are private
35. E - Nice
36. C - Even number, odd number <= 9, odd number > 9
37. E - 
      I: 1 3 5 
      II: 1 3 5
      III: 1 3 5
38. A - x and y act independently of oneanother, so thay must be spereated by an  ||. (in other words, one does not need the x conditionals and the y conditionals to both be satisfied. But both x conditionals need to be satisfied.)
39. 16 - see picture

    1. len = 5;
       temp = "WATC";
       wID("WATC") --> len = 4
       		       temp = "WAT" --> len = 3
		       	      	    	temp = "WA" --> len = 2
					       	    	temp = "W"
	WATC
